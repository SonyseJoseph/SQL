SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JANSALES
WHERE length (orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'orderID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(Product)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length (orderID)=6;

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers Cust
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Sales
ON cust.order_id=Sales.orderID
WHERE LENGTH (order_id)=6
AND order_id <> 'orderID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT Product, Price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY Price ASC
LIMIT 1;

SELECT SUM(quantity)* Price AS Revenue, PRODUCT
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY PRODUCT;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

WHERE LOCATION= '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
Group BY product;

SELECT 
COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum)
,AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
